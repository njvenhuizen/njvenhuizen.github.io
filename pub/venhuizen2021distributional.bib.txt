    abstract = {Natural language semantics has recently sought to combine the
    complementary strengths of formal and distributional approaches to meaning.
    However, given the fundamentally different 'representational currency'
    underlying these approaches—models of the world versus linguistic
    co-occurrence—their unification has proven extremely difficult. Here, we
    define Distributional Formal Semantics, which integrates distributionality
    into a formal semantic system on the level of formal models. This approach
    offers probabilistic, distributed meaning representations that are
    inherently compositional, and that naturally capture fundamental semantic
    notions such as quantification and entailment. Furthermore, we show how the
    probabilistic nature of these representations allows for probabilistic
    inference, and how the information-theoretic notion of "information"
    (measured in Entropy and Surprisal) naturally follows from it. Finally, we
    illustrate how meaning representations can be derived incrementally from
    linguistic input using a recurrent neural network model, and how the
    resultant incremental semantic construction procedure intuitively captures
    key semantic phenomena, including negation, presupposition, and
    anaphoricity.}
